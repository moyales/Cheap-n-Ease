        <p id="aboutUs-paragraph">Our goal is to provide students with a tool that helps them keep track of their expenses during their time
            at Stevens. These could include lunch, gifts, items, etc.
            Just like it says in our motto, we focus on providing a free tool to all users who may wish to save money
            or keep track of their expenses in college, and we make it as easy to use as possible.
